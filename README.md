# Snake-Game

A very basic classic Snake game written in Python, using Pygame. Works as expected: The player character cannot make a 180 degree turn on the spot as this would end the game. 
A score can be seen in the top left corner of the screen, this increments with each 'food' block eaten. 

Hitting the playable-space edge or running into the snake's tail results in a game-ver. The player is presented with a choice of quitting or starting a new game via the Escape
and Space keys.

Controls:

Arrow Keys for movement </br>
Escape to close the game </br>
Space to restart (Only during the game-over screen)
